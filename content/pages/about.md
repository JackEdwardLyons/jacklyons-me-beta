Hi there, my name's Jack Lyons. I'm an expert front end React and Vue developer from Brisbane, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º. My preferred tech stack includes Vue.js or Nuxt.js on the front end coupled with Node.js on the back end. I enjoy working on responsive, mobile-first websites, web app's and SaaS products.

When I'm not coding you can usually find me outdoors rock climbing, travelling the world, digital nomadding from cafes and coworking spaces or attending dev meetups. I also write rock climbing and travel articles on my other blog called [**Adventureinmyveins**](https://www.adventureinmyveins.com). It's an adventure publication crafted for rock climbers and mountain lovers who want to travel the world & build a location independent lifestyle.

My background is in Urban Planning and I have a degree from the University of Queensland. I have also studied abroad in Austria, where I learnt German, studied Environmental Sustainability at the Karl-Franzens-UniversitÃ¤t\* Graz\* ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹. It was there at university where I also met my wife Zoe [***@wildblend.***](https://www.instagram.com/wildblend/)

While I don't work as an urban planner anymore, I am still deeply interested in the emerging wave of "[**urban tech**](https://www.quora.com/What-is-urban-tech)" and "[**smart city**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city)" startups around the world. I would love to merge my passion for web and software development to solve the challenges of our modern built and natural environment. If you are looking for a front end developer for your urban tech startup, then please let me know!

Currently I am living on the Gold Coast, after travelling the USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ for past 12 months in 2019. During that time I was fortunate enough to work for some excellent clients both in Australia and in the United States. This included [**Adore Beauty**](https://jacklyons.me/portfolio/adore-beauty/), [**SoldNest**](https://jacklyons.me/portfolio/soldnest/), [**EvacGuide**](https://jacklyons.me/portfolio/evac-guide/) and [**Paleo Hacks**](https://jacklyons.me/portfolio/paleohacks/)**.**

At present I am open to new opportunities but realistically only have about 15 extra hours up my sleeve. If you require help on a short, medium, or long term basis, please keep that in mind.

If you are looking for an expert React or Vue developer, feel free to message me via the [**contact page**](https://jacklyons.me/contact).
