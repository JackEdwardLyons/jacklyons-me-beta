Class Ltd is Australia’s pioneer in cloud-based wealth accounting technology. They are an ASX listed company serving over 3,600 accounting and administration firms nationally and internationally.

My role as a lead front end developer included building out Class's new and improved [Trust Tax Return](https://www.class.com.au/our-solutions/class-trust/) form experience. The solution was written in TypeScript amd Vuejs using Nuxt. Some notable milestones and key pieces of UI included:

- The complete development of the Trust Tax Return form solution from scratch.

- Closely working with the design team to deliver a high quality and meaningful user experiences through modern user interface design and development

- A scalable and highly flexible series of form builder components to allow the Class Ltd team to rapidly create new forms and fields

- Mentoring the entire Class Avante Garde team on best practices with Vue.js and TypeScript as well as front end fundamentals

- Liasing with key stakeholders to understand the core project requirements and drive out key decisions for a successful delivery of the project

- Ensuring the delivery of the core solution well within the time frame allocated

Overall it was a fun experience consulting and working with Class Ltd. I wish them all the best on their future development of the Trust Tax Return solution.
