[**RACQ**](https://racq.com.au/) offers insurance, assistance, banking, car and solar products across Queensland and Australia. RACQ is owned by over 1.7 million members and have been a force for good in Queensland communities for over 117 years.

I took on a six month contract role at RACQ to help build out a new car comparison tool with a focus on EVs and low emission vehicles.

The tech stack included Vuejs, TypeScript and Pinia integrated with a headless Sitecore JSS implementation using GraphQL.

Some notable highlights include:

- Integrating vehicle data from the Australian Motoring Service API
- Creating complex filter controls to allow users to search, sort and filter vehicles based on a wide range of vehicle data
- Presenting complex data sets with a major focus on UI/UX best practices
- Numerous bug fixes and enhancements
