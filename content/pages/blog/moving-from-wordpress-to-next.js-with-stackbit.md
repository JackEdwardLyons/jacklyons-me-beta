  I was horrified when I recently tried to lookup my WordPress site on my
  mobile. It took close to ten seconds to load! That was enough for me to say
  goodbye to WordPress once and for all. Hello Next.js!

    There are no excuses for slow websites in 2021. WordPress is bulky and slow,
    and Next.js is blazing fast. In this post I show you how to make the change.

Moving from WordPress to a static site generator like Next.js has been a huge goal of mine for over two years. My site was taking up to 10 seconds to load on mobile devices which was unacceptable. I wish I got to this sooner, but you know how it is: moving content from one platform to another can be incredibly time consuming. Plus, I was scared of losing valuable SEO rankings. While my SEO will likely suffer short-term, I think this is a better long-term decision for numerous reasons, many of which I will outline below.

In this post I will describe what exactly went into making the change, from initial research and planning to execution and optimisation. Not everything has been figured out just yet, but as a developer I love knowing that I can figure it all out with code. What I like about Next.js and StackBit is that I can dive deep into the code at any time while still maintaing a high level of content customisation through the StackBit studio.

Here's what I was looking to achieve with my site migration:

*   My website has to be fast and score above 90 when running a [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) test.

*   I want to use modern tech such as [React.js ](https://reactjs.org/)or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), coupled with static site generation.

*   I want to host my site on GitHub and write my posts in markdown.

*   I don't want to use a server to load my content and I don't want to pay for a server too!

*   I want a tool to help with content management, SEO and basic page and asset updates.

*   I want my site to be hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so I can control deployments, form submissions and asset optimisations

*   I want full control over my site styles, components, configuration and dependencies.

Was it all achievable? Yes, yes and yes. Here's how I did it:

#### Choosing the tech stack

*   Next.js with static site generation

#### Finding the right tool to manage my content

*   stackbit

*   SEO

*   Markdown editor

*   Content and asset management

#### Linking to GitHub and Netlify

*   Instant previews

*   Form submissions with Netlify

#### Google Lighthouse 

*   Yes, my site scores above 90

#### Full Control Over My Code

*   Yes, with GitHub and StackBit internal code editor
