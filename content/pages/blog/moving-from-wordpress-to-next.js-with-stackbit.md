    There are no excuses for slow websites in 2021. WordPress is bulky and slow,
    and Next.js is blazing fast. In this post I show you how to make the change.

Moving from WordPress to a static site generator like Next.js has been a huge goal of mine for over two years. After realising my site was taking up to 10 seconds to load, I knew something finally had to be done. I wish I got to this sooner, but I thought this would be incredibly time consuming and I was scared of losing valuable SEO rankings. While my SEO will likely suffer short-term, I think this is a better long-term decision for numerous reasons, many of which I will outline below.

In this post I will describe what exactly went into making the change, from initial research and planning to execution and optimisation. Not everything has been figured out just yet, but as a developer I love knowing that I can figure it all out. What I love about Next.js and StackBit is that I can dive deep into the code at any time while still maintaing a high level of content customisation through the StackBit studio.
