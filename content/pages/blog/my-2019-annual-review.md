Now that we are well and truly in the swing of the 20's, it’s time to take a second and reflect back on the last year of the decade! Each December I do my best to take stock and journal my Annual Review — adapted from James Clear, the master of **[Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).**

As per usual, this Annual Review will answer three questions:

1. **What went well this year?**
2. **What didn’t go so well this year?**
3. ****What am I working towards?****

For those who know me but don’t regularly see me: you’re probably thinking I’m off on some tropical island writing this from a jungle hut. While I do wish that were the case, I can say with certainty that I’m currently back in Australia and plan to hang around for a while longer (than usual).

But let’s not spoil everything, how about I jump right to it.

1. **What went well this year?**

2019 was the year of travel, travel, travel. It was a big year of first-times in new countries. In 2019 Zoe and I travelled to

 - Bali 🇮🇩,

 - Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 (new),

 -  Morocco 🇲🇦 (new),

 - Austria 🇦🇹,

 - Hungary 🇭🇺 (new),

 - Slovakia 🇸🇰 (new),

 - USA 🇺🇸 (including lots of new places),

 - Mexico 🇲🇽 (new),

 - Alaska 🐻 (new),

 - Hawaii 🌺 (new),

 - Hong Kong 🇭🇰 and China 🇨🇳.

It all seems a bit of a blur, but in total we spent 10 months of 2019 abroad. Not everything went smoothly and not every new place was amazing — however that didn’t matter. What mattered most (and always will) is that I got out of my comfort zone, explored new terrain, experienced new food and made new memories with wonderful people.

No matter what, I’d like that to always be my inspiration and guiding motivation in life. I want to continually explore our beautiful planet, meet new people and share adventure stories from faraway places.

In honour of that, I'd like to thank my good mate [**Daniel**](https://unsplash.com/@single_lens_reflex) for a super fun road trip through Slovakia. Dave for letting Zoe and I crash with him in Boulder! Matt for taking me climbing in Boulder and coming with me to China. My mate Luke from Boston, for coming out to visit me and spending the weekend catching up! And my wife, Zoe, for always wanting to share new adventures with me.

On the professional front this year was a really foundational time where I started to find my footing as a Front End Web Developer. After quitting my job at Squiz early in the year, I was left to forge my own path as a freelancer.

In order to find work as a freelancer I rely heavily on my personal website as a landing page and contact point, as well as LinkedIn and Upwork. I have built up a solid reputation on Upwork as a five-star freelancer. That helps drive traffic to my profile, where clients can contact me directly.

This year I was fortunate enough to work with some great clients, two of my favourites being [**Adore Beauty**](http://adorebeauty.com.au/) (Australia’s largest online beauty store) and [**SoldNest**](https://www.soldnest.com/) (A real estate startup out of San Francisco).

I managed to negotiate a decent hourly rate, combined with a flexible work-week, allowing me the freedom to work at anytime, anywhere, for as long or as little as needed. I found the sweet spot to be around 25 hours a week. Some weeks more, some less — it all depended on where we were travelling and what we were doing.

The best part about working and travelling is that you don’t have to sacrifice any life savings to go out and have an adventure. You earn as you go, which in my opinion is a much more sustainable way to go. Plus, it doesn’t leave you depressed when you come home and have no money and no job.

The ultimate freedom would be to earn money passively through an online business so you can truly spend more time outdoors, trekking the globe! I’m not there yet, but hope that’s possible one day.

Fast forward to October and finally Zoe and I landed back in Aus, where we immediately moved down to Currumbin Valley, on the Gold Coast. We found a dream house to rent, with enough space to run around in the yard and have a veggie garden, all just 10 minutes from the beach. I cannot believe it - things just happened so quickly — we found the place privately on Gumtree and sealed the deal before even getting back to Australia!

Zoe has been instrumental in making the house feel like a home, and I can see she has a talent for decorating and interior design. I was able to dust off the old record player and spin some vinyls, which I love! Zoe’s quickly becoming a plant-mum, too, and the kookaburra’s are getting us up everyday before the sun rises. I do NOT think we will ever be moving back to the city!

And to cap this year off — I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the incredible climbing trip I went on to China in November with my buddy Matt, from Colorado. This past year has been riddled with injury which left me off the rock for months and months. Matt helped me overcome some serious physical and mental blocks and we had an incredible week of stellar climbing in Yangshuo! That trip has given me a new wave of confidence that I sorely needed.

So, thank you Matt!

**2\. What didn’t go so well this year?**

I had a knee surgery done at the end of 2018 which set me back hugely. To this day I still have joint pains and muscle atrophy which I’m continually working on. It is improving, but throughout this year I was set back considerably when it came to rock climbing.

It wasn’t just the pain and weaknesses in my legs and lower back, it was also a mental problem where I absolutely didn’t trust myself when climbing, running, or hiking on advanced terrain. I was too afraid of hurting myself.

I know this sounds dramatic, but because I rarely got outdoors to go climbing, I began to feel a piece of my identity slip away. It wasn't until later in the year when I went on my trip to China that I realised just how important climbing really is to me. If I didn’t go on that trip I probably would have let it just fade away and out of my life. I’m glad that didn’t happen.

Work-wise I did have one hiccup that didn't go as planned (and likely burned a bridge or two). While still overseas I was contacted about a job opportunity back in Australia and after some back and forth, I decided it would be nice to come home and get settled with a job. However, after a few months there I quickly realised it just wasn't a good fit and incredibly bad timing.

Zoe and I were deep in the throes of setting up the house and simply organising our lives back in Aus. Plus, after a year abroad working for myself I just wasn't ready to give up my time and energy to this new startup. To be fair, they were great - it was just bad timing for me. It sucks to have to be the bad guy and mess up other people's lives.

**3\. What am I working towards?**

A few things immediately come to mind:

- **Buying a first home:** it’s time to get in the property game and stop pouring money down the drain in rent. I want a home Zoe and I can grow into, add our own touches and have space for pets and playing in the yard. I also see a home as an investment in our long-term future.
- **Climbing outdoors in new locations**: either here in Australia or overseas. Bottom line is that I’d like to get outdoors at least (_at least)_ once a month, if not more.
- **Relaunching Adventure In My Veins:** I had a _really_ good thing going back when I ran my rock climbing blog. It was so much fun to connect with climbers and “digital dirtbags” and that’s something I sorely miss. I plan to get the site back up and continue writing about digital dirtbagging.
- **Building an online business:** I know that’s incredibly vague but I really do want to figure out how I can combine my passion for web development into a business that earns me an income. I have the skills, but just lack the gumption to execute an idea in it’s entirety.
- **Completing the level B1 German Exam:** Whenever I travel back to Austria I’ve always felt inadequately prepared. I usually stumble my way through speaking German to friends and family, but it never feels nice. This year I want to study and practice so I can pass the level B1 German Exam.
- **Making new friendships here on the Gold Coast:** It’s daunting moving to a new place and not knowing anyone! It’s time to get out there and try new things and hopefully make some friends along the way.
- **Strengthening and healing my knee, improving overall fitness:** This one’s purely about putting in the hours, working out hard and pushing myself to get stronger and more confident.
- **Having a great relationship with Zoe:** I can’t forget to let Zoe know that she’s the most important person in my life. She does so much in this relationship and I need to pull my weight a little more, and contribute to improving our lives together everyday.
- **Learn to cook well, play more guitar, and make time for hobbies:** Life should be fun and active. I want to remove myself from the computer more often and make more time to practice new skills and hobbies.
