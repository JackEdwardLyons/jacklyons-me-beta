Are you an IT recruiter who is constantly getting shut down when calling developers?

If you do get through, are you the "_the 5th person to call with a â€˜really cool roleâ€™_" on any given day?

---

As a web developer I hear from **_a lot_** of recruiters. Usually I'm OK with them pitching their shiny new job opportunity but **not over the phone.** Often, I'm just time poor and donâ€™t have a few minutes to hear the pitch. Well, that's my default answer anyway. But to tell you the truth, there's actually more to it than that.

If you're an IT recruiter in software or web development please read this post carefully as I'm going to explain why your cold call approach just won't work when trying to fill a new developer role.

#### It's not you, it's me.

Developers are logical creatures who are always looking to optimise any given outcome. While this usually only matters in day-to-day coding, it also translates over to personal life from time to time. This is especially true when both **time** and **money** enter the equation. Put simply, developers don't want to waste their time on the phone if it doesn't make logical sense, especially if the salary or day rate isn't known upfront.

The number one reason why developer's don't (or won't) pick up your phone calls is because there is too much uncertainty at stake. **We need answers to the hard facts first before engaging in a potential time-wasting endeavour.**

As a recruiter, I know you so eagerly want to explain how great Company X is with their ping pong table and open-plan office. But please, just stop. The reality is, we don't care - well not initially anyway.

Developer's don't want to be cold called to hear your pitch (aka be sold to). That's because they want to optimise our lives away from uncertainty towards **a data-driven solution that can quickly (and logically) be determined.**

#### Before calling a developer, make sure you can answer these 4 simple questions:

1. How much does it pay?
2. What is the tech stack?
3. Can you send me a clearly defined job description?
4. Can I work from home or do I have to go into an office from 9 to 5?

If you don't follow these steps then your cold call will likely be rejected or shut down very quickly.

My best recommendation is to first contact developers via email or LinkedIn with answers to the above 4 questions. Keep your message short and sharp.
If the developer chooses to engage with you by showing interest, then you'll have a much greater chance at progressing to the next step over the phone.

And hey, maybe they will like the idea of that ping pong table after all ðŸ˜„

#### In summary

State the facts upfront & you'll have a better chance of getting a developer on the phone.

It's not that we are against phone calls. it's just that **the phone call should always be the second step in the developer-recruiter relationship**. The developer must first determine if the opporunity is of interest and that can only happen if you provide the facts upfront.

If the dev likes what they read then your odds of getting them on the phone will skyrocket.
