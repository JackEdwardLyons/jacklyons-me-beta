Are you an IT recruiter who is constantly getting shut down when cold calling developers?

Are you the "_the 5th person to call with a ‘really cool role’_" on any given day?

---

As a web developer, I hear from **_a lot_** of recruiters. Usually I'm OK with them pitching their shiny new job opportunity but **not over the phone.** Often, we're just time poor and don’t have a few minutes. But in all honestly, it goes deeper than that.

If you're an IT recruiter in software or web development please read this post carefully as I'm going to explain why your cold call approach just won't work when trying to fill a new developer role.

#### It's not you, it's me

Developers are logical creatures who are always looking to optimise any given outcome. While this usually only matters in day-to-day coding, it also translates over to personal life when both **time** and **money** enter the equation. Put simply, developers don't want to waste our time if it doesn't make logical sense.

The number one reason why developer's don't (or won't) pick up your phone calls is because there is too much uncertainty at stake. Developers need answers to the hard facts first before engaging in a potential time-wasting endeavour.

Most importantly, developer's don't want to be cold called. They prefer hearing from you via email or online message (LinkedIn) with straight up answers to the obvious facts. That's because we want to optimise our lives away from uncertainty and more towards hard data where a solution can quickly (and logically) be determined.

#### Before cold-calling a developer, make sure you can answer these 4 simple questions:

1. How much does it pay?
2. What is the tech stack?
3. Can I work from home, or on my own schedule or do I have to go into an office?
4. Will I have creative flexibility to go outside of the box, or are there many layers of red tape to go through?

---

If you can follow these simple steps and be sure to contact developers via email or LinkedIn first then you'll have a much greater chance at getting them on the phone _if they are interested._

#### In summary, state the facts, then wait...

It's not that we are against phone calls. it's just that **the phone call should always be the second step in the developer-recruiter relationship** once the developer has determined the opporunity to be of interest.

**If we like what we read then your odds of getting us on the phone will skyrocket.**
