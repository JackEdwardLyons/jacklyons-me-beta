In my 2023 Annual Review I will answer three key questions:

1. **What went well this year?**
2. **What didn’t go so well this year?**
3. **What am I working towards?**

Drafting a yearly review has become a ritual for me to take stock over the passing years. Since becoming a father, the need to capture and remember key milestones has intensified, as life appears to be racing ahead right in front of me. In the midst of juggling a never-ending and intensely demanding work schedule, parenting a __lively__ toddler, and navigating the perpetual challenge of carving out personal time, the practice of crafting an annual review is a valuable compass for self-reflection.

### 1. What went well this year?

#### Koa growing up

In 2023, my world has revolved around witnessing Koa's rapid growth and development! When asked about my well-being, conversations inevitably circled back to Koa and her journey. She is my priority, and thinking of her always took precedence over myself. It might sound cliché, but even with the advantage of working from home and being by her side daily, I still find it hard to believe how swiftly she's grown up.

Being a part of Koa's journey has been truly remarkable. While I never envisioned fatherhood in a concrete way. Now, as a dad, I can genuinely say it's an extraordinary gift to witness your child's growth and development firsthand. Koa's spirited nature, her infectious giggles, and her ceaseless curiosity for the world have kept me on my toes. Despite this being one of the most challenging years of my life (details to follow), reflecting on it now, everything seems to have gone remarkably well. She's not just thriving; she's alive, healthy, and for that, I'm incredibly grateful!

Life with Koa, and life in general, is gradually becoming more manageable. With each passing month, things get a tad easier, a bit better, and my confidence in navigating fatherhood steadily grows. Koa is currently achieving so much, and it's an absolute joy taking her on our daily walks, spending time at the park, and exploring the world together. She's brimming with laughter and boundless excitement, especially when encountering new things, particularly animals! Managing Koa for more extended periods is becoming smoother, affording Zoe more well-deserved time off. I'm learning the ropes, ensuring she's adequately dressed, well-fed on our outings, equipped with fresh clothes and nappies – all the essential dad responsibilities are gradually becoming second nature.


#### Vedic Meditation

More content to come.

#### Work

Launched the Car comparison tool at RACQ. Working with great people.

### 2. What didn’t go so well this year?

#### Office pod construction 

Still underway ...

#### Austria trip

Not so well this year

#### Stress and burnout (again)

Unfortunately this year was marked with a lot of stress and tension, fighting and anger due to the overwhelming nature of raising a newborn. Both Zoe and I have had a hard time adjusting to this new life, despite the fact that we love Koa to death. Managing work, all the responsibilities of parenthood as well as household duties has just been too much. We have both suffered without proper support from family. I hate that we have both been so rattled by this experience, but I also know that it’s an integral part of the journey.

With the new year comes a dedicated effort to resolve all that isn’t serving me and to be better in every way I can. The difficulties of this past year have been a huge driver for me to look inward and go on these plant medicine journeys I highlighted above. I know things will get better, but I don’t want to sugar coat the pain and suffering that we have both had to deal with throughout this past year.

#### Lots of up's and down's

Relationship up's and down's

### 3. What am I working towards?

#### Yoga teacher training

200 Hour YTT

#### More side project and learning new tech!

Next.js, AI, TypeScript, Full stack development !!

And that wraps up my 2023 annual review. It's been a year marked by intensity, stress, and a rollercoaster of emotions. Yet, within these challenges, I find the seeds of a new beginning. I'm genuinely thrilled to step into the upcoming year with a fresh perspective and a considerably more positive outlook. In 2023, my focus is on internal growth, aiming to shed limiting beliefs, internal stressors, and self-talk that may have held me back. Here's to the anticipation and excitement that 2023 holds—bring it on!
