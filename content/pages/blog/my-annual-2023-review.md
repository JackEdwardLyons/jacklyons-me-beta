In my 2023 Annual Review I will answer three key questions:

1. **What went well this year?**
2. **What didn’t go so well this year?**
3. **What am I working towards?**

Drafting a yearly review has become a ritual for me to take stock over the passing years. Since becoming a father, the need to capture and remember key milestones has intensified, as life appears to be racing ahead right in front of me. In the midst of juggling a never-ending and intensely demanding work schedule, parenting a __lively__ toddler, and navigating the perpetual challenge of carving out personal time, the practice of crafting an annual review is a valuable compass for self-reflection.

### 1. What went well this year?

#### Koa growing up

More to come


#### Vedic Meditation

More content to come.

#### Work

Launched the Car comparison tool at RACQ. Working with great people.

### 2. What didn’t go so well this year?

#### Office pod construction 

Still underway ...

#### Austria trip

Not so well this year

#### Stress and burnout (again)

More info to come.

#### Lots of up's and down's

Relationship up's and down's

### 3. What am I working towards?

#### More side project and learning new tech!

Next.js, AI, TypeScript, Full stack development !!

#### Yoga teacher training

200 Hour YTT for personal growth and development.

And that wraps up my 2023 annual review. It's been a year marked by intensity, stress, and a rollercoaster of emotions. Yet, within these challenges, I find the seeds of a new beginning. I'm genuinely thrilled to step into the upcoming year with a fresh perspective and a considerably more positive outlook. In 2023, my focus is on internal growth, aiming to shed limiting beliefs, internal stressors, and self-talk that may have held me back. Here's to the anticipation and excitement that 2023 holds—bring it on!
