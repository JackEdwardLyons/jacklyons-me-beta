> If you don't have a plan, you become part of somebody else's plan.

In my 2022 Annual Review I will answer three key questions:

1.  **What went well this year?**
2.  **What didn‚Äôt go so well this year?**
3.  **What am I working towards?**

I can't believe 2022 is over already (_I'm sure literally everyone feels the same way)._ On the on hand I feel relieved because I can finally allow myself to take stock and look back on what the heck really happened. But on the other, I know that the world will _never_ go back to how it was.

But, you know what? That's life. All we can do is suck it up and move on with what we've got.

Let's begin!

**2022 Year in Review**

In my 2022 Annual Review I will answer three key questions:

1. **What went well this year?**
2. **What didn‚Äôt go so well this year?**
3. **What am I working towards?**

Writing a yearly review is one of the best ways for me to check in on the year that‚Äôs passed. Now that I am a father I feel like I need to remember more of the milestones that were because right now life seems to be flying by at warp speed. Watching my little girl grow up is an amazing experience. However, with the groundhog day rush of morning and evening routines, working all day, and the general chaos of raising a child, I simply can‚Äôt keep on top of everything. This is my chance to check in.

1. **What went well this year?**

**Koa growing up**

2022 has been the year of watching Koa grow üòÖ. When anyone asked me how I was doing the conversation would inevitably wind up talking about Koa and her development. It was impossible not to think of her before myself. It‚Äôs cliche to say, but even with me working from home and being there every day, I still can‚Äôt believe how fast she‚Äôs grown.

It‚Äôs been really incredible to be part of this journey. I never really thought of being a dad in the literal sense but I deep down always knew I wanted to have a family. Now that I am a dad I can say that it really is an amazing gift to watch your own child grow and develop before your eyes. Koas fiery spirit, her cute little giggle and constant seek for new and interesting things has definitely kept me on my toes. It‚Äôs been one of the most challenging years of my life (of which I will discuss later) but I feel like, looking back on it all, it all went pretty damn well. I mean, she‚Äôs alive and healthy, so I‚Äôm grateful for that!

Things are getting easier with Koa and life in general. With every month she grows things just get easier. She‚Äôs capable of so much right now and it‚Äôs really fun taking her around with me. We go for morning and evening walks and spend plenty of time down at the park. She‚Äôs full of giggles and always excited when she sees something new, especially animals! It‚Äôs getting easier for me as a dad to take Koa for longer, and give Zoe more time off. I‚Äôm getting better at being prepared, ensuring she's dressed properly, has food for the road, fresh clothes and nappies, and all that fun stuff.

**Austria trip**

By far the biggest and best milestone of the year was our family trip to Austria for a month over May-June. Both Zoe and I were nervous about the flight with Koa only being nine months old at the time. Luckily I had lowered my expectations because it really was a pretty pretty horrible experience üòÖ. But like all things in life, we eventually made it to the other side and were warmly welcomed by Zoes family.

The trip didn‚Äôt start off too great though. Unfortunately we all ended up getting COVID from the flight. First Koa, then Zoe and then me, all a few days apart from each other. Luckily, we all fought it off within a week or so and I‚Äôm just so proud of little Koa for battling it out to make a full recovery at such a young age.

Despite COVID, we did not let it get in the way of my holiday plans. Over the entire month I climbed almost every second day. I spent a ton of time climbing outdoors with my mates and sampled all of the top bouldering gyms in town. It was epic. After nine months of just being in hardcore dad-mode I finally had the free time to climb my heart out.

For me, our trip to Graz was probably the biggest highlight of the year. Catching up with family, friends, making new friends, and just soaking up the vibrancy of Europe in springtime is all just so good for the soul!

**Work**

Workwise things went well this year. I started out the year in a full-time role that wasn‚Äôt quite a good fit for me. I handed in my resignation after four months but on good terms with everyone at the company. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal though, as I knew my old company well and I could see that the pipeline of work just didn‚Äôt fit in with my personal career goals. They were grateful for my honesty and we ended things on good terms. I‚Äôm still in contact with the team at Pipefish and wish them all the best for the future!

Shortly after I found a new contract for a government agency called CleanCo. And now I am currently on another contract working with Nintendo Australia as my main client. I have realized that I am just more suited to short-medium term contract work. As a contractor I can pick and choose from a wide range of industries and technology stacks, plus it‚Äôs a great way to stay sharp and continually learn new tech. It‚Äôs also nice to be my own boss.

**Plant medicine journeys**

This year I had two major plant medicine journeys that have truly blown my mind and forced me to reevaluate everything that is holding me back in life. It‚Äôs taken a lot of courage to want to do these journeys but I‚Äôm glad I have persevered even in the presence of an unclear intention or the understanding of what I am going to get out of the experiences. But on both occasions this year I was rewarded with some incredible insights into life, death, consciousness, health, wellness and love.

I was most nervous about the first journey earlier in the year because about a year prior I had a really intense and confronting journey that I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. This time around I was scared of having the same experience. I knew deep down that I had to face my fears and build the courage to give it another go so I could resolve all the things that came up previously.

The biggest difference from past journeys was that on both occasions this year I went in with a clear intention as to why I was taking the medicine. The first journey I focused on tuning into my body and exploring areas that needed healing. I followed a mostly vegetarian diet on the lead up and I practiced a lot more yoga, meditation and calming exercises in order to get in the right headspace. It‚Äôs an incredibly taxing experience both mentally and physically, and these medicines need to be treated with absolute respect for their power to take control of the body and mind. I know a lot of people who liken plant medicine journeys to that of a near death experience. I certainly can vouch for that.

During my first journey of the year, I was taken on a full inner body excursion. It felt like I was gliding through my bloodstream. There were these moments along the way where I would run into blockages in my body. When this occurred there was an immense rush of ‚Äúbeings‚Äù that came to force out whatever was obstructing the flow. Like little lemmings, or worker bees; they came in such numbers and with so much force that eventually they pushed the blockages free. In those moments I felt a surging rush of warmth to areas of my body: my eyes, my stomach, my back. All areas where I had experienced some form of chronic pain throughout my life. It was such an amazing feeling and unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced before.

What was sad and beautiful about this experience was that these little worker beings fought their way through my body and purged me of these blockages only to go on and sacrifice themselves, all for nothing in return. Their sole purpose was to heal and to love and I felt so selfish for being on the receiving end of such a wonderful gift. I was grateful, happy, sad and just amazed at the beauty of it all.

On my second journey, which only occurred a few weeks ago, I had an intense ego dissolving experience that lasted the better part of five hours. It was strong and relentless and exactly what I needed after such a tough year. During this experience there were many moments where I completely disconnected from all thoughts and bodily experiences and simply merged with what felt like a field of pure consciousness. I could see clearly what it‚Äôs like to just exist as my pure self without anything holding me back. The journey gave me a lot of great insights into who I am right now and _who I know I am_ deep inside. What does this mean exactly?

Well, it is my interpretation that the self is the purest form of who you are. It is where you don‚Äôt have to act a certain way or be a specific kind of person, you just are ‚Äúyou‚Äù without any limitations. However, we have all had past experiences that shape us into who we are today. Negative experiences are damaging and cause us to create a shield so that we are guarded from future pain. When this happens, the true self is layered with this new guard which one ends up carrying through life forever, unless it‚Äôs brought to the surface and dealt with.

It‚Äôs not until we have a realization moment, either through plant medicine, deep meditation or therapy, that we recognise the role these ‚Äúguards‚Äù play in our lives.

I know it sounds bizarre and I don‚Äôt expect everyone to believe it. All I can say is that these medicines are very powerful as they have the ability to open up your mind and body to an elevated level of consciousness. I‚Äôm drawn to these experiences because I can see just how important they are to helping me unblock all my past patterns, behaviours and limiting beliefs. However, I will say that this kind of work isn‚Äôt for everyone. If this is something that sounds interesting and you want to chat about it more then feel free to reach out.

### What didn‚Äôt go so well this year?

**Full time work**

The year started off with me working at a startup spinoff that my previous employer, Pipefish, had founded. Initially I was really excited to be back on board with the team because I had a really great working relationship with them throughout 2020-21. The product, called SyncFish, is an extremely promising piece of commercial technology. I have absolutely no doubt that it will do well. However, the role just didn‚Äôt suit me and the pipeline of front end development work was actually quite limited. Anyway, after about four months or so I let them know it just wasn‚Äôt for me and luckily they were great about it and actually really appreciative that I was honest and upfront.

I followed that role up with a new contract with a government owned renewable energy company called CleanCo. That role focused on developing a trading platform for electricity traders to buy and sell wholesale renewable energy from various electricity production facilities across Queensland. The work was somewhat interesting and I did get to work on some fun features, but the workload and intensity of output was massive. After working on various government contracts for the past 2+ years, I felt that it was time to try something new and move on. All in all, while these two roles weren‚Äôt so aligned for me personally, I still feel as though I learned a ton of valuable skills professionally.

**Stress and burnout **

Unfortunately this year was marked with a lot of stress and tension, fighting and anger due to the overwhelming nature of raising a newborn. Both Zoe and I have had a hard time adjusting to this new life, despite the fact that we love Koa to death. Managing work, all the responsibilities of parenthood as well as household duties has just been too much. We have both suffered without proper support from family. I hate that we have both been so rattled by this experience, but I also know that it‚Äôs an integral part of the journey.

With the new year comes a dedicated effort to resolve all that isn‚Äôt serving me and to be better in every way I can. The difficulties of this past year have been a huge driver for me to look inward and go on these plant medicine journeys I highlighted above. I know things will get better, but I don‚Äôt want to sugar coat the pain and suffering that we have both had to deal with throughout this past year.

**Lack of outdoors time**

Lastly, what didn‚Äôt go well this year was my lack of climbing outdoors. While I had an epic month of climbing in Austria, the rest of the year I only got outdoors two or three times. Climbing outdoors is a huge part of my life and one of the best ways to reduce stress and rebalance. I need it in my life and feel like a piece of me is missing or broken when I‚Äôm not getting my outdoor climbing fix! Hopefully all that will change in 2023 because we have some pretty big plans!

### What am I working towards?

**Living in Austria for 12 months **

In 2023 Zoe and I plan to move to Austria for twelve months or more. We are planning to set off in May once my current contract ends. After getting a taste of Austria for a month in 2022, we are both super excited to move there and settle in for a year of wacky adventures! I am excited because I know I will be able to climb outdoors a lot more. I have an amazing group of friends there who all just love being out in the mountains and the best part of living in Austria is that the mountains are just so close and accessible, unlike here on the Gold Coast where the closest climbing area is about 45 minutes away + 45 minute hike.

We will be close to Zoe‚Äôs family so it will be great to have some extra support to help out with Koa. It‚Äôs also a great chance for me to continue learning German as well. And of course, it‚Äôs an opportunity for us all to travel Europe as a family!

I haven‚Äôt quite figured out what I‚Äôll do for work at this stage, but I‚Äôm not overly worried. I can freelance or contract, or even work for a company in Austria as I‚Äôm planning to get a permanent residence visa. More importantly I think this is a great chance to reset and realign my career goals and potentially try something new for a change.

**Diving deeper into Ayurveda and other holistic health practices**

In 2023 I am working towards building a more consistent and well rounded yoga practice. I am also deeply interested in the ancient Indian health science of Ayurveda, of which yoga is a part. Ayurveda covers everything from diet, exercise, home remedies and wellness practices all the way through to advanced psychology, treatment of diseases such as cancer and everything in between. It‚Äôs a holistic solution that looks to nature for answers and explains disease in terms of imbalance of our core natural elements.

For me, Ayurveda explains a lot about who I am and why I am how I am. The more I read and learn the more I have these ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments where everything makes sense why things are how they are. So in 2023 I would like to expand my daily routines to incorporate more Ayurvedic practices and learn to cook more holistic, healing meals.
