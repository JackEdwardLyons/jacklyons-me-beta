      I'm a front end web developer from Brisbane, Australia. I enjoy building
      modern web sites and applications with Vue, React, ES2020+, TypeScript,
      GraphQL, TailwindCSS and Sass. Contact me today for help on your next
      project!

      - title: Vue.js
        content: >
          My front end framework of choice is Vue.js. I love working with Vue as
          it allows me to write clean, powerful code and prototype fast! I'm
          also a big fan of Nuxt.js for building Server Side Redered
          applications.
      - title: React.js
        content: >
          I also enjoy working with React.js coupled with TypeScript. React is
          just as powerful as Vue, but it does involve more technical decision
          making and code co-ordination with other third party libraries. React
          is a great tool for building powerful, modern web apps and I
          especially love using React Hooks and Functional Components.

          Apollo is the industry-standard GraphQL implementation, providing the
          data graph layer that connects modern apps to the cloud. REST APIs are
          not a good fit for modern apps because they require large amounts of
          hard-to-manage data fetching code. With Apollo, components simply
          declare their data requirements using GraphQL and Apollo gets the
          right data to the right place!

          WordPress is by far the most popular platform for custom client
          websites. I also use it to build eCommerce websites too.
